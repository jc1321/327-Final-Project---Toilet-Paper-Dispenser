# 327 Final Project - Toilet Paper Dispenser
## Project Overview <br>
For our final project, we have created an automatic toilet paper dispenser to create a luxurious bathroom experience. <br>
<br> 
As the user enters the bathroom, our motion sensors triggers a series of actions. One activates the buzzer, turns on the LED strip, and changes the message displayed on the LCD. The LED strip displays a line of 35 distinct colors, and the buzzer plays 3 songs. The user can press the button to change between the 3 songs played, and triggers the motion sensor to change the message displayed from "Welcome! Enjoy your stay!" to "Goodbye! Have a nice day!". <br>
The second motion sensor triggers a DC motor which is attached to the toilet paper roll. The user can wave the motion sensor off to stop the rolling, creating a hands-free bathroom experience. <br> 

## Hardware Architecture <br>

3 MSP430s make up our hardware architecture. <br> 
* MSP430 #1 drives the buzzer, a DC motor, a button, and 2 motion sensors. P2.1 connects to the anode of the buzzer and P2.5 connects to the cathode side. P2.4 connects to motion sensor #1 that is driven by 5V, which controls the LED strip and the buzzer. P2.3 connects to IN1 of the motor driver which is driven by 3.3 V, OUT2 routes to a 5.1Î© resistor and the DC motor, and OUT1 directly connects to the other side of the DC motor. P2.0 connects a button that's also driven by 3.3V. P2.2 connects to motion sensor #2 that is driven by 5V. <br>
* MSP430 #2 drives the LED strip. The LED strip consists of 35 LEDs and 4 pins - VDD, Cl, Dl, and GND. VDD is connected to 5V, Cl to P1.5 and Dl to P1.7. <br>
* MSP430 #3 drives the LCD screen. VSS V0 and RW are grounded and VDD is connected to 5V. D4-D7 connects to P1.2-P1.5 on the MSP430. P2.4 is connected to motion sensor #1. <br>
